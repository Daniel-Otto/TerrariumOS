# Terrarium Plants & Inhabitants

Suitable plants and animals for a TerrariumOS-controlled tropical terrarium.

---

## Target Environment

TerrariumOS is designed for **tropical day-active species** with the following parameters:

- **Temperature:** 22-28°C (day), 20-24°C (night)
- **Humidity:** 55-70% (day), 70-85% (night)
- **Light Cycle:** 10-12 hours (seasonal variation)
- **Habitat:** Tropical rainforest simulation

---

## Example Species: *Sphaerodactylus elegans*

### Elegant Dwarf Gecko

**Care Level:** Intermediate

**Size:** 5-7 cm (including tail)

**Terrarium Size:** Minimum 45x45x60 cm for 2-3 geckos

**Temperature:**
- Day: 24-28°C
- Basking spot: 30°C (short duration)
- Night: 20-22°C

**Humidity:** 60-80%

**Diet:** Micro crickets, fruit flies, isopods

**Activity:** Diurnal (day-active)

**Social:** Can be kept in small groups (1 male, multiple females)

**Notes:**
- Requires naturalistic setup with climbing structures
- Benefits from seasonal light variation
- Sensitive to temperature extremes
- Egg-laying species (oviparous)

## Suitable Plants

### Ground Cover

| Plant | Scientific Name | Light | Humidity | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|----------|-------|
| Tropical Moss | Various | Low-Medium | High | Retains moisture |
| Fittonia (Nerve Plant) | *Fittonia albivenis* | Low-Medium | High | Colorful, compact |
| Baby Tears | *Soleirolia soleirolii* | Medium | High | Fast-growing |

### Climbing Plants

| Plant | Scientific Name | Light | Humidity | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|----------|-------|

## Plant Requirements

### Light Levels

TerrariumOS provides:
- **Full daylight:** 6700K fluorescent (6-10h)
- **Dawn/Dusk:** 4500K LED (1-1.5h)

Most tropical terrarium plants thrive under **low to medium light**. The 6700K tube provides sufficient PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) for growth.

### Watering

- **Automated rain system:** Morning and evening misting
- **Manual watering:** Not required if rain system is properly configured
- **Drainage:** Essential to prevent root rot

---

## Other Suitable Inhabitants

### Micro Geckos
- *Sphaerodactylus* species (various)
- *Gonatodes* species
- *Lygodactylus* species (day geckos)

### Dart Frogs (Advanced)
- *Ranitomeya* species
- *Oophaga pumilio*

**Note:** Dart frogs require more specialized care and different parameters.

### Invertebrates (Cleanup Crew)

| Species | Purpose | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Isopods (Pill Bugs) | Decomposers | Essential for bioactive setup |
| Springtails | Mold control | Prevent mold growth |
| Earthworms | Soil aeration | Optional |

---

## Bioactive Setup (Recommended)

A **bioactive terrarium** includes a cleanup crew (isopods, springtails) that processes waste and maintains soil health.

**Benefits:**
- Self-sustaining ecosystem
- Reduced maintenance
- More natural for animals

**Requirements:**
- Drainage layer (hydro balls / LECA)
- Substrate barrier (mesh)
- Organic substrate (coco fiber + soil + leaf litter)
- Cleanup crew (isopods + springtails)

---

## Safety & Ethics

- **Only purchase captive-bred animals** (never wild-caught)
- Research species-specific care requirements
- Ensure terrarium is fully set up and stable before adding animals
- Monitor temperature and humidity closely during first weeks
- Have a backup plan (manual timer, backup sensor)
